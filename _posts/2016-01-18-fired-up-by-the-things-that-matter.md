One person's trash is someone else's treasure. This was how Elise Aguilar discovered the latent photographer in her. About 2 decades ago, while in college, Elise was introduced to her lifelong passion when a friend decided to upgrade his photo gadgets and give away his manual SLR, complete with fancy lenses and accessories, packed in a really nice bag. This friend's refuse turned out to be one of the best gifts that Elise ever received in her lifetime. 

Being a busy college scholar back then, Elise studied the intricacies of photography by devouring on the contents of the manual whenever her time permitted. The application of what she learned through self-study was a sequence of trials and errors that painfully ate up a bulk of her allowance. It was after all the film era then, when one can't possibly progress in photography unless she invested on film and printing. The joy and satisfaction that Elise derived from learning photography the hard way was incomparable and well worth it because she discovered a hobby which she will undoubtedly enjoy long before she has outgrown her other interests. 

To these days Elise has captured innumerable images of practically anything that catches her fancy. She has a way of breathing life into even the most mundane and inanimate subjects such as bolts, knots and geometric figures. From her photo collections, it is clear too that Elise has a natural fondness for photographing landscape and nature in general. An insatiable wanderlust, Elise enjoys traveling and experiencing life. It is interesting to note that her discipline as a photographer has altered her perspective as a traveler. Elise does not think of travel as a need to move out of one's city, country or continent. Like most who have developed the elusive photographer's eyes, this lady photographer is able to experience novelty in even the most familiar setting, and see something remarkable out of what many will regard as dull. 

This accomplished lady, whose right-brain and left-brain hemispheres seem to compete for dominance has in her an unusual combination. A Math wiz since grade school, she earned a BS in Mathematics in college, worked on her MS in Computer Science, completed a Nursing degree, and ended up being a licensed Doctor of Medicine. But she is not all about exact sciences. In College, she used to sketch her classmates and teachers while in class. And while this writer has not seen any of her sketches, the fact that the recipients looked forward to owning the sketches is enough proof of its magnificence. Elise is also a competent photo editor and digital artist, a skill, which she is able to maximize; given the fact that photography often goes hand-in-hand with digital arts these days. As if it weren't enough, this lady is also a prolific writer. She is also an animal rights advocate who has adopted 10 cats and 3 dogs from the street. 

In spite all her accomplishments, Elise is not one to compete for others' stamp of approval, thus her lack of enthusiasm to join photo contests. For her, a photograph is effective only when it moves a person to thought, to reflection, to an emotion and consequently, to action. With her photos, this intelligent and talented lady wishes to present a change-effecting stimulus so that viewers will find beauty and meaning in their seemingly ordinary existence and be fired up by things that really matter.
